# mbentley/omada-controller

Docker image for [TP-Link Omada Software Controller](https://support.omadanetworks.com/us/product/omada-software-controller/) (also known as TP-Link Omada Network Application) to centrally manage [TP-Link Omada Hardware](https://www.omadanetworks.com/en/business-networking/all-omada/).

**Disclaimer**: I am not, in any way, affiliated with TP-Link. I am just a community member who has packaged TP-Link's free software as a Docker image for easier management and consumption.

## Just Getting Started?

Check out the [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/mbentley/docker-omada-controller?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart-guide) for the basics of what you need to know about running the TP-Link Omada Controller in a container and how to operate it successfully.

## v5 to v6 Upgrade Guide

The upgrade from v5 to v6 requires a manual step of running an upgrade container for MongoDB. Check out the [v5 to v6 Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/mbentley/docker-omada-controller?tab=readme-ov-file#v5-to-v6-upgrade-guide) in the full README for detailed instructions.

## Full README

For the full readme which includes a list of tags, including usage examples, upgrade details, known issues, and more, refer to the [README in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/mbentley/docker-omada-controller/blob/master/README.md).

## Getting Help & Reporting Issues

If you have issues running the controller, feel free to [create a Help discussion](https://github.com/mbentley/docker-omada-controller/discussions/categories/help) and I will help as I can. If you are specifically having a problem that is related to the actual software, I would suggest filing an issue on the [TP-Link community forums](https://community.tp-link.com/en/business/forum/582) as I do not have access to source code to debug those issues. If you're not sure where the problem might be, I can help determine if it is a running in Docker issue or a software issue. If you're certain you have found a bug, create a [Bug Report Issue](https://github.com/mbentley/docker-omada-controller/issues/new/choose).
