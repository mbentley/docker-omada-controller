        What is the version of the Omada Controller that you're running? This can be found in the hamburger menu (three dots) in the upper right hand corner of the main screen and under 'About' or in the container startup logs. This is *not* the image tag (i.e. - not `latest`)

        Collect logs by using something similar to `docker logs omada-controller >& output.log` if needed and attach them or copy out the relevant portions of the error. When in doubt, do both. I can't help without logs!
